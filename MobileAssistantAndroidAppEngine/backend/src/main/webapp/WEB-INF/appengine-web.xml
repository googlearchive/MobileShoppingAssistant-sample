            User : Before you run your application, you need a Google Cloud Messaging API key.
            To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:
                https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=googlecloudmessaging&keyType=SERVER_SIDE&r=0.0.0.0/0
            Once you have your API key (which starts with “AIza...”), replace the "gcm.api.key" string in this file.
            -->

        <property name="gcm.api.key" value="YOUR-GCM-API-KEY"/>
